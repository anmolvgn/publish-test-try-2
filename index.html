 	<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>I graduated from the Denver School of Science and Technology (DSST) Stapleton HS. Despite my initial STEM education and training in secondary eduation, I took a different path in y postsecondaary eduaction at CSU. Despite having obtained a BA in Economics and Political Science and concentrating on social and political factors and policies rather than the natural, I still possess an active, healthy and insatiable appetite in learning the natural sciences. This is true in growing and learn in other technical fields like data science and web development. Currently, I am working on improving and expannidng my skills by taking couses in web development and taking management schoolentrance exams to earn a CPA certification and a MBA along with plans to earn a Juris Doctorate. Above all, I appreciate having economic freeedom in my source of income and the tasks and projects I undertake.</p>
